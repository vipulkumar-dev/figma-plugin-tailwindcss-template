# **ðŸ”Œ Currently Under Development**

This is the template that I wish I had when I first started building out [Bricks](https://github.com/bricks-cloud/bricks).

#### **Technologies Used**:

1. Typescript
2. React
3. Tailwindcss
4. Webpack
5. Yarn

#### **To get started**:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
2. Run `yarn install` in the repository's root directory.
3. Run `yarn run dev` to start building.
4. Right Click in Figma -> "Plugins" -> "Development" -> "Import plugin from manifest..."
5. Click on "+" -> import plugin from manifest -> Select `./dist/manifest.json` file to import the plugin
6. Click on "Run" to start the Figma plugin in development mode.
